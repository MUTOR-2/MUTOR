Two hashes produce a subsection heading

### Subsubsections

Three hashes get you a subsubsection

# Images

## Markdown

The Markdown syntax to place an image in the text looks like this:

![Descriptive text](/MUTOR/assets/img/sin-amp-period.png)

This will simply put an image at this location in the file, but we can use the syntax below 
to include a figure number with a caption, so please don't use the raw markdown syntax for images.

## Liquid

This is the syntax to use for placing an image with a figure number and caption:

{% include figure url="/MUTOR/assets/img/sin-amp-period.png" description="Descriptive text" %}

See how nice that is??

# Test questions and references

Test questions and references will appear at the bottom of the unit in the order that they are listed in 
the preamble above. Unfortunately, this is not a full-blown citation system like LaTeX includes, so if you want to refer to
a particular reference by number inline in the text, you'll have to do it by hand [2].

{% include cite ref="weisstein_fourier_transform" %}

{% include references %}
