# Introduction

In this unit we will look at scales and harmony from the perspective of perception and cognition of music. In units 4 and 5 we have already learned about consonance and dissonance as well as pitch, intervals and key areas, resp. Harmony are beased on those principles, e.g. we expect chords to have low sensory consonance and we also are keenly aware of when chords don't seem to fit. 

[Webster's dictionary](http://www.m-w.com) defines harmony in reference to music as (1) the combination of simultaneous musical notes in a chord, (2) the structure of music with respect to the composition and progression of chords or (3) the the science of the structure, relation, and progression of chords. Colloquially, harmony also often denotes the pleasing or congruent arrangement of parts.

As we can see from the above definition, the word harmony often refers to either a chord, a progression of chords, or a consonant (or generally speaking, pleasing) sonority.  The task of defining harmony is a difficult one—is it a chord or a progression of chords?  How are harmony and harmonic progression different from timbre and timbral evolution?  In this unit, we will discuss these questions and look at how composers in the 20th and 21st centuries view harmony.  We will also look at the effects that tuning systems have on harmony.

Scales are the collection of pitches, harmonies and melodies are formed from. They usually span the interval of an octave and repeat when going beyond it. The pitch of the individual tones within a scale depends on a variety of factors which have undergone changes throughout history as composers focussed on aspects such as pure sonorities or being able to modulate to distant key areas. It turns out that using 12 pitches per octave is the result of a compromise, but there has been an interest throughout history to consider scales with fewer or many more pitches per octave. The deviation from the standard is usually referred to as microtonality. 


# Historical View of Harmony

The term harmony comes from a Greek word that translates literally as "means of joining" and is related to the word for joint or shoulder [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=harmony].  In ancient Greek music, the term referred to the juxtaposition of different elements, but since the musical practice of the time did not include the simultaneous sounding of multiple notes, this concept was only used as a way of discussing the theoretical relationships between pitches.  In the Medieval period, composers began to write music in which two notes that formed a perfect consonance (fourths, fifths, or octaves) were sung simultaneously, and in the Renaissance Gioseffo Zarlino wrote of triadic harmony that included the imperfect consonances:  thirds.  These descriptions pertain only to the structure of an isolated simultaneity, although it is clear that as far back as the 15th century, theorists understood the concept of harmony to encompass not only the relationships between simultaneously sounded pitches, but the relationships between chords.  Additionally, some theorists have considered harmony to be the progression through, and alternation of, consonant and dissonant sonorities.  

The distinction between harmony and harmonic progression is an important one.  Consider, for example, the C major chord in figure 1.

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/unit9_cmaj.png" description="C major triad" %}

In the key of C major, this chord has a feeling of stability since it is the tonic of the key.  However, in the key of F major, the same chord will sound less stable as if it should move to F.  As we can see, the context in which a chord appears is important.  Another example is the famous "Tristan chord"—the opening harmony of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde (figure 9.3).  The nature of this sonority has been debated for decades, but the debate centers less around the chord itself, and more around the function and way in which it resolves.

The chord can easily be explained as a half-diminished seventh chord or as a French augmented 6th chord where the G# is an appoggiatura  to the A, however, the way in which it resolves calls these labels into question.

# Tuning and Temperament

Since the time of J.S. Bach, equal-temperament has dominated western classical music.  In this system, every semitone is of equal size in log-frequency (remember that our perception of pitch is logarithmic).  For a given number of semitones, n, we can calculate the frequency from a reference f_r using the formula

\begin{equation}
f_n=f_r(\sqrt[12]{2})^n
\label{eq:Equal-Temperament}
\end{equation}

Although a thorough discussion of tuning is beyond the scope of this unit (Wikipedia has numerous pages and links devoted to the topic), we can say a few things about equal temperament and the systems that it replaced.

Any tuning system must be measured against just intonation in which intervals are calculated by integer ratios, e.g. a just fifth is 3 / 2, a just fourth is 4 / 3, and a just major third is 5 / 4.  Although the just intervals are considered by many to be the most pleasing, they can lead to complex problems.  For example, a just major third above A1 (55 Hz) is 68.75 Hz, but if we use 55 Hz (A1) as our reference frequency and calculate a C#1 by going up in fifths, we arrive at 69.609375 (55 • 1.5 = 82.5 (E2) • 1.5 = 123.75 (B2) • 1.5 = 185.625 (F#3) • 1.5 = 278.4375 (C#4) / 4 = 69.609375).  One solution to this problem is to tune certain keys as perfectly as possible and allow other more distant keys to be out of tune.  Equal temperament solves the problem by making every interval (with the exception of the octave) slightly out of tune.  For example, in the case of perfect fifths, in equal temperament,

\begin{equation}
55(\sqrt[12]{2})^7 = 82.4069
\end{equation}

and in just intonation, 

\begin{equation}
55\cdot(\frac{3}{2}) = 82.5
\end{equation}

An important technique that defines common practice music is the modulation to distant keys.  As the harmony moves away from the home key, tension increases, however, in a tuning system where the tonic key is tuned near just intonation and the degree to which a key is out of tune increases with the distance from the home key, modulation to distant keys results in a higher level of tension.  In the following listening example, you will hear the first minute of a Capriccio (FbWV 506) by Johann Jakob Froberger (1616-1667) played on an organ tuned to meantone temperament). In the second listening example, you will hear the same passage, but played in equal temperament.

# Period Tunings
Theorists have created tunings from either deriving them from overtone series (just-intonation tuning) or stacking fifths (Pythagorean tuning). Stacking four fifths on C leads to an E which is considerably sharper (81/64; 408 cents) than the E contained in the overtone series (5/4; 386 cents). This discrepancy - mathematically represented by the ratio 81/64 * 4/5 = 81/80 = 21.5 cents - is called the Syntonic comma. Since no tuning can exist mathematically where all thirds and fifths are just, musicians have attempted to make up for this by modifying either thirds and/or fifths — an approach referred to as _temperament_. 

## Meantone Temperament

During the Renaissance and Baroques eras meantone temperament was wide-spread: lowering fifths to keep the thirds as just as possible. 
There were a number of variants, quarter-comma and third-comma meantone temperament among them. The term quarter-comma, for instance, emphasizes the fact in this temperament the just fifth (702 cents) is lowered by an interval corresponding to a fourth of Syntonic comma (21.5 cents / 4 = 5.375 cents): 696.6 cents. Other temperaments have been suggested by Werckmeister, Valotti and others all geared towards allowing modulcation in distant key areas while keeping thirds and fifth as pure as possible.

Many of these tunings and temperaments lead to tuning alternatives for any given key. For instance, in just intonation an Ab (8/5) is different from a G# (25/16). Keyboards such as the archicembalo built in 1588 have been constructed to represent tuning alternatives. 

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/unit9-Archicembalo_en_Cents.jpg" description="The Archicembalo had a large number of tuning alternatives for the 12 keys of the chromatic scale." %}

A comprehensive list of tunings and temperaments (currently more than 4600 files) can be found in the [Scala Archive](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/microtonality/scales.html).

# Equal Temperament

The ultimate compromise has been achieved by introducing equal temperament - the tuning of choice in the Classical, Romantic and Modern periods. Here, the discrepancy between 12 fifts and 7 octaves (Pythagorian comma; 23.46 cents) is tempered out by dividing up the comma evenly (1.96 cents) and applying this value to all fifths: 701.96 cents - 1.96 cents = 700 cents. 

By tempering out fifths, the above-mentioned tuning alternatives become enharmonically equivalent, e.g. there is no longer a distinction between a G# and Ab. Due to equal temperament, approaches such as dodecaphony (invented by Arnold Schoenberg in 1923) and total serialism were developed, which treat all tones equally and subject them to mathematical set operations.

## Ambiguity

We have already mentioned that the role of a chord depends on its context. Changing this role facilitates modulation such as when the tonic triad of C major is being reinterpreted as the subdominant of G major, C major serving as a pivot chord between those two key areas.
Via enharmonic equivalence, equal temperament adds another dimension to modulation: there is no audible distinction between the dominant seventh chord (C-E-G-Bb; a dominant in the key of F) and the German 6th chord (C-E-G-A#, a secondary dominant in the key of E). This ambiguity of the sonority has been exploited by composers in the Classical and Romantic periods to quickly modulate to distant key areas. 
As the dissonant Bb is resolved by downward motion (inwards) while the leading tone A# moves up (outwards),  this type of pivot chord is comparable to the ambiguous cube illusion (a type of a Necker cube) where a cube can either be perceived as projecting inwards or outwards. 

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/unit9-Ambiguous-Cubes-Illusion.jpg" description="Ambiguous Cubes Illusion" %}

Looking at the image for an extended period of time or periodically, the perspective of the cubes will flip as the brain recognizes and realizes their ambiguity, but it can only represent one state at a time. In music, the harmonic frame of reference is given by the key area the chord is presented in, forcing one state over the other. But by dwelling on the ambiguous sonority, composers prepare the listeners for the flip and lead them to realize the other state in a context where the precise timing of the event also matters.

# Microtonality
The term microtonality refers to the systematic exploration of tonal relationships that can not be derived from our tempered or quasi-tempered tuning. By comparison with the steps of the 12-tone tempered tuning (also called 12TET = "12-tone equal temperament”), in microtonal tunings deviations are smaller than 100 cents are common. Hence the term microtonality.


In the field microtonality, we can distinguish at least two schools of thought:

## Just Intonation
Representatives of this movement, which American composer Harry Partch ("Genesis of a Music") had a large impact on, focus on  intervals that can be derived from the overtone series and its inversion, the undertone series. Parth refers to this as O-Tonality and U-Tonlity. In the process, rather unusual intervals such as 11/7 or 7/3 come to the center of attention.

## Equal Divisions 
### Divisions of the Whole Tone
The need for small subdivisions of the whole tone into four (quartertone tuning or 24-tone equal temperament [24TET] also known as equal devision of the octave in 24 steps [24EDO]) and six (36TET) was already theorized and practiced at the beginning of the 20th Century by composers such as Busoni, Haba, Wishnegradsky and Ives. The Mexican composer Julian Carrillo had a piano patented in 1940 with a keyboard in 16th notes (96TET)spanning just one octave. The 72-step "ekmelic" tuning closely approximates most of the lower harmonic overtones, 

### Other Divisions of the Octave
53TET is derived from stacking fifths and tempering out the small _schisma_ between 53 fifths and 31st octave. It was known to Chinese scholars in antiquity. 

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/unit9_53TET-in-Max.png" description="Calculation of 53TET" %}
Figure 4. Calculation of the 53-step equidistant tuning in Max
{% include note author="vg" text="Redo in English or create online version" %}

53TET features a __diatonic__ pitch set which also exists in temperaments such as at 17TET, 19TET (1/3 comma mean-tone tuning), 22TET, 31TET (1/4 comma mean-tone tuning) and 41TET. 

These temperaments obey the following rule: 5 * m * s + 2 * n * s = 1200, where s is the step size of the temperament, and m and n are integers to be multiplied with s by to yield a diatoic whole tone or a semitone, resp. 

This also applies: 5 * m + 2 * n = number of steps in the temperament. 

The following condition should also be fulfilled: 694 cents < (3 * m + n) * s < 710 cents.

Examples:
For 12TET: m = 2 and n = 1,
For 17TET: m = 3 and n = 1,
For 19TET: m = 3 and n = 2,
For 22TET: m = 4 and n = 1,
For 31TET: m = 5 and n = 3,
For 41TET: m = 7 and n = 3.

### Divisions of Other Intervals 
The octave is a particular interval that creates a sense of unity with other other members of the same pitch class. In addition to the octave, of course, other intervals can be divided. Intervals that have been used extensively for this purpose are the just fifth (3/2) and the just twelfth (3/1), the latter bearing a close similarity to the octave. Examples are the scales (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) invented by microtonal composer Wendy Carlos and the Bohlen-Pierce scale.

#### Bohlen-Pierce Scale
The Bohlen-Pierce scale, first discovered and described in 1978 by engineer Heinz Bohlen divides the just twelfth into thirteen steps. The just version of the scale has a pitch set entirely made up of odd integer frequency ratios such as 5/3, 7/5, 7/3, 9/7 and 9/5. Some people also refer to this as 7-limit just intonation without 2 (3,5,7 pitch lattice).

These intervals are also included in the spectrum of the clarinet, which is one of the few wind instruments that blow over at the twelfth. What could be more appropriate than developing a clarinet with the Bohlen-Pierce tuning? http://www.sfoxclarinets.com/bpclar.html. The equal tempered version of the scale is a  matches the just one much more closely than the 5-limit just and equal tempered versions of the chromatic scale.

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/unit9_clarinets.png" description="Bohlen-Pierce clarinets in three sizes" %}

{% include note author="vg" text="Include Example: Burning Petrol" %}


##### Bohlen-Pierce Microtonality
As the equal-tempered step size of the Bohlen-Pierce scale is 146.3 cents, it is often referred to as a macrotonal scale, implying that the step size is larger than a semitone. But just like semitones of the chromatic scale, the Bohlen-Pierce scale can also be devided into smaller steps. Two microtonal scales have gained notoriety: The Bohlen-Pierce triple scale dividing the BP step into 3 and the Bohlen-Pierce quintuple scale dividing it into 5. Serendipitously, the resulting step size (1902 / 65 = 29.262 cents) is all but identical to 41TET (1200 / 41 = 29.268 cents). We can therefore claim that the Bohlen-Pierce is a subset of 41TET. This fact has far-reaching implications which have hardly been explored by composers and theorists.

## Other Scales
Another classes of tunings can not be classified into one group or the other. This includes the Indonesian pelog (gamelan music), which has a set of 5 small and 2 large unequal intervals, of which only 5 are used in traditional Gamelan music. According to William Sethares these instruments are tuned in such way that overall sensory dissonance of the mainly inharmonic sounds of the Gamelan orchestra reaches a minimum. Another way to smooth out the unpleasantness of the inharmonic sounds is the pair-wise performance of instruments tuned to slightly divergent pitch which creates vibrato-like beatings.
(The other scale commonly used in gamelan music, Slendro, is characterized by a quasi-equidistant 5-tone scale.)

# Harmony in the 20th/21st Centuries

## Tension and Release

The progression of harmony from consonance through dissonance and back to consonance can be abstracted and seen as a buildup of tension and a release of that tension.  The serialist composers of the post-war period (Boulez, Stockhausen, etc.) gave up the ability to create tension and release through harmonic progression as they abandoned the sonorities and harmonic syntax of the past.  The generation to follow (Grisey, Murail, Saariaho) sought new ways of creating tension and release without returning to the rules of the past.  In her article Timbre and harmony: interpolations of timbral structures, Kaija Saariao proposes a "sound / noise axis" that could replace the tonal system of consonance / dissonance as a way of creating tension and release.  This is hear clearly in the opening seconds of her composition Nymphea for string quartet and electronics—here, the performers alternate between normal playing and noisy extended techniques such as playing on the bridge (listening example 3).

[PAGE FROM SCORE HERE]

In works such as Gérard Grisey's Partiels and Tristan Murail's Gondwana, the composers create a relationship between harmonicity and inharmonicity.  In this case, the concept of harmonicity refers to similarity to the harmonic series.  In Partiels, the opening sonority - a harmonic series derived from the acoustical analysis of a bass trombone - is gradually transformed into an increasingly inharmonic sonority by gradually placing the highest pitches into lower octaves.  In figure xx, the top graph is a sonogram of the opening 2'30" of Partiels and the bottom is a plot of the roughness (see the unit on consonance and dissonance) of the sonority over time created using a modified version of Richard Parncutt's algorithm.

Listening example 4. The first 3'40" of Grisey's Partiels.

Although Grisey uses a very different system of harmony in Partiels, one can still see a constant transition between consonance and dissonance or tension and release. About this issue, the composer writes in his own words:

> Two traits characterize the development of sounds:  periodicity and the overtone spectrum. These elements, which are very easy to identify, give the piece continuity and a dynamic that corresponds rather closely to the cyclical form of human respiration: inhalation, exhalation and rest or tension / collapse — relaxation — collection of energy.

## Harmony, Timbre and Transformation

The opening section of Partiels raises an interesting question:  is there a difference between a chord and a timbre?  In this case, it would seem that Grisey constructed a chord out of the elements of a timbre.  But, if a timbre is made up of a series of pitches, how is it different from a chord?  In most western classical music prior to the 20th century, harmony and timbre were considered two separate elements—the orchestration of a sonority could be done in many different ways and was often considered a subjective, surface-level detail.  However, in the 20th century, composers such as Olivier Messiaen began to think of timbre and harmony as inseparable, and it is likely that Grisey would refer to the opening sonority of Partiels as a timbre rather than a chord.  

A novel feature of Partiels is the idea of gradual timbral / harmonic evolution.  In the past, harmonic change and movement to new key areas was largely a discrete event, however, here, by only changing a few notes at a time by placing them in different octaves, Grisey creates a smooth transformation from one sonority to another.  David Wessel has developed a Max (http://www.cycling74.com) object that facilitates gradual timbral transformation.  Here, a timbre is created using a large bank of sinusoidal oscillators and a gradual transformation to a new timbre is done by changing the frequency of one oscillator at a time.  Download the following patch to experiment with different timbral transformations.

# Summary
In this unit we have learned about scales and harmony. Harmony is a complex notion that refers both to the pleasantness of simultanously sounding notes as well as the logic in which one sonority moves to another within a given framework such as a key area. A scale contains the tones from which sonorities are formed. These tones can be tuned to pitches according to various principles of which just intonation and equal temperament are examples of. The theory and practice of microtonality takes advantage of the fact that scales can be formed from a virtually unlimited number of pitches. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the principles of tension and release have been expanded by taking musical parameters such as roughness and inharmonicity in consideration.
