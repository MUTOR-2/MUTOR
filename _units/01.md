title: The Auditory Stimulus
number: 1
short_description: Introduction to the physics of sound and its mathematical and digital representation.
summary: What we experience as sound is really a response to small variations in pressure that affect our inner ear. In this unit, we will discuss the physical properties of these pressure waves and how they propagate through a medium (air). We will also discuss the mathematical and digital representations of these waves.
