# What Do We Hear?

Sound is all around us, invisible, yet ever present in our daily lives, 
but what exactly is it that we hear? In this unit, we focus on the 
physical phenomena that affect our perception of sound, and different
ways we represent those phenomena.

When I make a sound, say I clap my hands together, I've produced a 
disturbance in the air that eventually travels to your ears, 
resulting in an effect that we ultimately describe as sound.
This disturbance travels in every direction, reflecting
differently off of every surface, walls, the floor, the ceiling, bodies,
furniture, etc. depending on their materials. This is all caused by 
air molecules bumping into each other; as they move away from the 
source of the sound, they create a region of higher pressure 
by *compressing* the space between themselves and their neighbors
in the direction they are traveling.
At the same time, the area in the opposite direction becomes a 
region of lower pressure, or a *rarefaction*. Our ears are particularly
sensitive to these very fast and very small changes in 
pressure---you can think of our ears as extremely sensitive barometers.

When those changes in air pressure propagate into our ears, they 
transfer their energy through a complex array of anatomy, ultimately
resulting in electrical impulses that travel up the nerve fibers
from our inner ear to our brain, where we cognitively process
this information as "sound". The transfers of energy from one
medium to another is called *transduction*, and the different parts
of our anatomy through which these pressure waves are *transduced*
as they make their way to our brain will be discussed in 
unit 2 {% include note author="jm" text="this should be a link to unit 2" %}.
For now, we will focus in this unit on physical characteristics of 
sound waves, and the ways we represent them.

The image in figure {{ fig_waveform }} may be a familiar
one---we might say we see a sound there, but it would be more accurate
to refer to it as a *waveform*, as sound is something we *perceive*
in time, rather than something we have and see as in this image.
In order to produce a visual representation of something that sounds,
we usually transduce the sound mechanically, such that its movements
produce a visible trace on some medium. In the earliest recording devices,
such as Thomas Edison's 
[phonograph cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_cylinder), 
a needle, moved
by sound vibrations, traced grooves in a wax cylinder. By reversing the
process, i.e. spinning the cylinder while touching the needle to it
and transferring the movement of the needle to a diaphragm, causing the 
tiny movements of the needle to displace a larger amount of air,
the recorded sound could be played back, as shown in the video below:

<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWLlbk_bI7E" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The playback in such a device relies on analog amplification: a heavy,
but small needle modulates a thin and light, but larger membrane that 
displaces a larger volume of air. Other recording and playback technologies
involve the transduction of air movement into an electrical signal. This
is done by using a small, light diaphragm to displace a coiled wire surrounded
by a magnet. These small movements of the coil relative to the magnet alter the 
magnetic field and produce
a very small electrical current, the voltage of which varies proportionally
to the compressions and rarefactions of the sound.

</div>

Speakers work in the opposite way: an electrical signal is sent to
a coil surrounded by a magnet, and the modulations in voltage cause displace
the coil and a membrane, or speaker cone, attached to it, which moves the air
back and forth.

*Digital* recordings make use of the *analog* electrical signal described
above, but record the value of the voltage *periodically*, by *sampling* it
commonly at 44100 times per second. This is done using an 
*Analog to Digital Converter* or *ADC*, and the process is reversed 
by a *Digital to Analog Converter* or *DAC*, which modulates
the voltage of an electrical signal proportional to the sampled values.

Analog and digital representations of sound are similar, but have some important
differences. Perhaps most importantly, analog signals are *continuous*,
while digital signals are *discrete*, i.e. they 
can be thought of as consisting of individual values
that were recorded by taking samples of an electrical voltage a finite number
of times, at equally spaced intervals in time. 
{% include begin-figure description="Digital (discrete) vs. analog (continuous)
representations of a signal" %}
{% include note author="jm" text="placeholder" %}
{% include end-figure %}
This process comes with advantages and disadvantages, the main disadvantage
being the loss of information between samples. During playback,
this lost information is reconstructed during the digital to analog
conversion process using a 
[reconstruction filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_filter).
The advantage of digital representation, however, is that we may operate on 
the signal numerically and computationally.

# Quantitative and Visual Descriptions of Sound in the Time Domain

Let's return to figure {{ fig_waveform }} and discuss its properties in more 
detail. The horizontal dimension represents time, and the vertical dimension 
represents *amplitude*, a physical property related to the perceptual
experience of *loudness*. This representation of a sound is said to be in 
the *time domain*, because it shows us how the signal varies as a function
of time. We should keep in mind, though, that what we experience as *sound*
involves the higher-order cognitive processing of a dynamically changing
3-dimentional signal as it interacts with our environment over time. By
contrast, figure {{ fig_waveform }} is a rather simple, two dimentional signal
that can more accurately be thought of as the digitally sampled voltage
of a transducer modulated over time by changes in air pressure at a particular
location in space.

Let's take a closer look at the details of a time-domain waveform.

## Time Domain Representations of Signals

{% include begin-figure description="A sine wave." %} 
<img src="/MUTOR/assets/images/sin-amp-period.png" alt="A sine wave" 
style="width: 100%;">
{% include end-figure %}
{% assign fig_sin=fignum %}

In figure {{ fig_sin }}, we see a special waveform called a *sine wave*.
A sine wave is special because it is *periodic*, meaning that its shape
repeats over and over again. The amount of time it takes for it to repeat
is called its *period*, and the number of periods that occur in one 
second is called its *frequency*. A sine wave is a plot of the position
along the y-axis of a point as it travels counter-clockwise around a 
unit circle, starting from the point (1, 0).
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/Sine.gif" 
                      description="The relationship between a sine wave
					  and the position of a point on the circumference
					  of a circle." %}

As we mentioned above, the physical property *amplitude* is related the 
perceptual experience of *loudness*. Additionally, the *frequency* of this
sine wave is related to the perceptual experience of *pitch*, with 
higher frequencies and shorter periods correlating to higher pitches.

The last property of this waveform is the *phase*. The phase is the position
in the period relative to some point that we determine to be the beginning.
A *cosine wave* appears exactly the same as a sine wave, shifted $1/4$
of a period to the left.
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/sin-cos-90phase.png" 
                      description="The relationship between a sine
					  and a cosine." %}
Where a sine wave was the position along the y-axis, a cosine wave
is the position of the same point along the x-axis.
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/Cosine.gif" 
                      description="The relationship between a cosine wave
					  and the position of a point on the circumference
					  of a circle." %}
Since the phase difference between a sine wave and a cosine wave is 
$1/4$ of a period, and that corresponds to our point having traveled
$1/4$ of the way around the circle, or $90^{\circ}$, we can say that 
the two have a phase difference of $90^{\circ}$.
