# What Do We Hear?

Sound is all around us, invisible, yet ever present in our daily lives, 
but what exactly is it that we hear? In this unit, we focus on the 
physical phenomena that affect our perception of sound, and different
ways we represent those phenomena.

When I make a sound, say I clap my hands together, I've produced a 
disturbance in the air that eventually travels to your ears, 
resulting in an effect that we ultimately describe as sound.
This disturbance travels in every direction, reflecting
differently off of every surface, the walls, the floor, the ceiling, bodies,
furniture, etc. depending on their materials. This is all caused by 
air molecules bumping into each other; as they move away from the 
source of the sound, they create a region of higher pressure 
by *compressing* the space between themselves and their neighbors
in the direction they are traveling.
At the same time, the area in the opposite direction becomes a 
region of lower pressure, or a *rarefaction*. Our ears are particularly
sensitive to these very fast and very small changes in 
pressure---you can think of our ears as extremely sensitive barometers.

When those changes in air pressure propagate into our ears, they 
transfer their energy through a complex array of anatomy, ultimately
resulting in electrical impulses that travel up the nerve fibers
from our inner ear to our brain, where we cognitively process
this information as "sound". The transfers of energy from one
medium to another is called *transduction*, and the different parts
of our anatomy through which these pressure waves are *transduced*
as they make their way to our brain will be discussed in 
unit 2.
For now, we will focus in this unit on the physical characteristics of 
sound waves, and the ways we represent them.

The image in figure {{ fig_waveform }} may be a familiar
one---we might say we see a sound there, but it would be more accurate
to refer to it as a *waveform*, as sound is something we *perceive*
in time, rather than something we have and see as in this image.
In order to produce a visual representation of something that sounds,
we usually transduce the sound mechanically, such that its movements
produce a visible trace on some medium. In the earliest recording devices,
such as Thomas Edison's 
[phonograph cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_cylinder), 
a needle, moved
by sound vibrations, traced grooves in a wax cylinder. By reversing the
process, i.e. spinning the cylinder while touching the needle to it
and transferring the movement of the needle to a diaphragm, causing the 
tiny movements of the needle to displace a larger amount of air,
the recorded sound could be played back, as shown in the video below:

<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWLlbk_bI7E" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The playback in such a device relies on analog amplification: a heavy,
but small needle modulates a thin and light, but larger membrane that 
displaces a larger volume of air. Other recording and playback technologies
involve the transduction of air movement into an electrical signal. This
is done by using a small, light diaphragm to displace a coiled wire surrounded
by a magnet. These small movements of the coil relative to the magnet alter the 
magnetic field and produce
a very small electrical current, the voltage of which varies proportionally
to the compressions and rarefactions of the sound. 
<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_crXXbuEKE" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Speakers work in the opposite way: an electrical signal is sent to
a coil surrounded by a magnet, and the modulations in voltage displace
the coil and a membrane, or speaker cone, attached to it, which moves the air
back and forth.

*Digital* recordings make use of the *analog* electrical signal described
above, but record the value of the voltage *periodically*, by *sampling* it,
commonly at 44100 times per second. This is done using an 
*Analog to Digital Converter* or *ADC*, and the process is reversed 
by a *Digital to Analog Converter* or *DAC*, which modulates
the voltage of an electrical signal proportional to the sampled values.

Analog and digital representations of sound are similar, but have some important
differences. Perhaps most importantly, analog signals are *continuous*,
while digital signals are *discrete*, i.e. they 
can be thought of as consisting of individual values
that were recorded by taking samples of an electrical voltage a finite number
of times, at equally spaced intervals in time. 
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/analogvdigital.jpg" 
description="Digital (discrete) vs. analog (continuous) representations 
of a signal" %}
This process comes with advantages and disadvantages, the main disadvantage
being the loss of information between samples. During playback,
this lost information is reconstructed during the digital to analog
conversion process using a 
[reconstruction filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_filter).
The advantage of digital representation, however, is that we may operate on 
the signal numerically and computationally.

# Quantitative and Visual Descriptions of Sound in the Time Domain

Let's return to figure {{ fig_waveform }} and discuss its properties in more 
detail. The horizontal dimension represents time, and the vertical dimension 
represents *amplitude*, a physical property related to the perceptual
experience of *loudness*. This representation of a sound is said to be in 
the *time domain*, because it shows us how the signal varies as a function
of time. We should keep in mind that what we experience as *sound*
involves the higher-order cognitive processing of a dynamically changing
3-dimentional signal as it interacts with our environment over time. By
contrast, figure {{ fig_waveform }} is a rather simple, two dimentional signal
that can more accurately be thought of as the digitally sampled voltage
of a transducer modulated over time by changes in air pressure at a particular
location in space.

Let's take a closer look at the details of a time-domain waveform.

## Time Domain Representations of Signals

### Frequency

{% include begin-figure description="A sine wave." %} 
<img src="/MUTOR/assets/images/sin-amp-period.png" alt="A sine wave" 
style="width: 100%;">
{% include end-figure %}
{% assign fig_sin=fignum %}

In figure {{ fig_sin }}, we see a special waveform called a *sine wave*.
A sine wave is special because it is *periodic*, meaning that its shape
repeats over and over again. The amount of time it takes for it to repeat
is called its *period*, and the number of periods that occur in one 
unit of time, say a second, is called its *frequency*. 
A sine wave is a plot of the position
along the y-axis of a point as it travels counter-clockwise around a 
unit circle, starting from the point (1, 0).
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/Sine.gif" 
                      description="The relationship between a sine wave
					  and the position of a point on the circumference
					  of a circle." %}

As we mentioned above, the physical property *amplitude* is related to the 
perceptual experience of *loudness*. Additionally, the *frequency* of this
sine wave is related to the perceptual experience of *pitch*, with 
higher frequencies and shorter periods correlating to higher 
*sounding* pitches, or notes.

### Phase

The phase is the position
in the period relative to some point that we determine to be the beginning.
The phase tells us how much of the periodic waveform has elapsed, and 
consequently, how much will have to occur before the waveform repeats.
Since phase is a representation of something that repeats or loops
over and over again, we can think of it as a point traveling around 
a circle, and indeed, 
phase is usually represented as an angle expressed in degress
($0--360^{\circ}$) or in radians ($0--2\pi$). 

A *cosine wave* appears exactly the same as a sine wave, shifted $1/4$
of a period to the left.
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/sin-cos-90phase.png" 
                      description="The relationship between a sine
					  and a cosine." width="400px" %}
Where a sine wave was the position along the y-axis, a cosine wave
is the position of the same point along the x-axis.
{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/Cosine.gif" 
                      description="The relationship between a cosine wave
					  and the position of a point on the circumference
					  of a circle." %}
Since the phase difference between a sine wave and a cosine wave is 
$1/4$ of a period, and that corresponds to our point having traveled
$1/4$ of the way around the circle, or $90^{\circ}$, we can say that 
the two have a phase difference of $90^{\circ}$.

#### How Does Phase Affect Sound?

If a sine wave and a cosine wave are identical with the exception of
a time shift, they should sound identical, right? Well they do. That 
doesn't mean that phase isn't important, but its affect on sound is 
not always intuitive. For a sinusoid by itself, it is impossible to hear
any difference, no matter where it started in its cycle. 
Where you can begin to hear a difference is when you start to combine different 
sine waves.

When two sinusoids are added together, the relationship of their 
phase and frequency determines how they sound. When they have the same
frequency and phase, the result is a sinusoid with an amplitude 
equal to the sum of the two. But when the phase of one of them is
exactly half that of the other, the two cancel each other out and produce
a flat waveform of 0 amplitude. Try shifting the phase of one sinusoid
against another in the example below.

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/MUTOR_DoesPhaseMatter1.png" 
description="Two sinusoids, one with variable phase with respect to the other." %}
{% assign does_phase_matter=fignum %}

You might notice a subtle change in pitch when you move the slider quickly---
this is because a shift in phase requires the waveform to "jump" forward
(or backward) faster (or slower) than it would have normally, and that
change in the speed of the evolution of the waveform is a temporary 
change in frequency.

In the figure below we have a more complex example containing 
four sinusoids of different frequencies. The phases can be randomized,
but the frequencies stay the same. Note that although the waveform
changes dramatically when the phases change, the *sound* doesn't change
much. This is important, because it tells us that while the time-domain
representation of a sound is certainly important, it does not often
tell us much about how a signal will actually *sound*. Below, we will
look at another representation of signals, the *frequency-domain*, but
before that, let's look at more complex waveforms.

{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/MUTOR_DoesPhaseMatter2.png" 
description="Changes in phase do not always produce changes in our perception 
of a sound." %}

### Summary

We have been looking at different *representations* of sounds, and
before moving on, we should be clear how these relate to the physical
phenomena they describe. The time-domain representation of a signal
can be thought of as representing changes in intensity that propagate 
through some medium, and the path through different media 
from some event in the world to your brain is a complex one: 
objects collide to produce fluctuations in air pressure, which enter 
your ear and are transferred through bone, fluid, hair cells, and finally
into the electrical signals of your nervous system. The 2-D drawings above
could just as easily represent any of these, just as they could also represent
the voltage as a function of time that moves a speaker cone back and forth
(that produces changes in air pressure), the displacement of that speaker cone,
etc.

# Pure and Complex Sounds

So far, we have been looking at simple, "pure" waveforms, i.e. signals
that can be characterized as having only a single frequency or pitch.
When we add simple sounds together, as we did in figure
{{ does_phase_matter }}, we produce *complex* sounds. The configuration
of the different frequency components relative to one another account for
much of the ways in which we experience *timbre* or the *tone color* of 
a sound, that is, the thing that makes a clarinet sound like a clarinet and
a piano sound like a piano (more on this in the unit on timbre).

When pure tones with frequencies that are integer multiples of some 
frequency are added together, we say that they are in a *harmonic* relationship;
all other sounds are said to be *inharmonic*. 
For example, if you had a tone that played at 440 cycles per second -- the 
pitch concert A that many orchestras tune to-- and added another tone that 
played at 880 cycles per second, this would create a harmonic relationship.
If you instead added a tone the played at 457 cycles per second, this would be
inharmonic. 

In reality, all sounds are complex---there are no truely pure sounds. 
The sinusoids we discussed above are only theoretical, and any physical 
representation of them contains other frequency components, no matter how small,
that distort their shape to some degree due to nonlinearities in the media
that carry them. Consider air, for example, which is not at a uniform temperature
and humidity everywhere. 
Since sound travels at a speed that is dependent upon temperature and
humidity, small changes in the air produce small changes that manifest as
*distortion* or *noise*.

# Frequency Domain Representations of Signals

As we saw in figure {{ does_phase_matter }}, the time-domain representation
of a signal is useful for certain things. For example, if you are editing 
some audio for a track you are working on in a digital audio workstation like
Audacity, Garage Band, or ProTools, it makes sense to be able to "see" the 
waveform of the sound as it progresses over time. 

From the amplitude of the wave you can see where it gets louder and depending 
on where you scroll on the wave you can find a specific point in the time of the track.
But there is still a lot of information in that complex wave that might be useful.

What if we could take a wave form and suspend it in time, then look at a portion of it to 
get a better idea of all the component parts that make up the complex wave?
In our next section, we look at a mathmatical technique called Fourier transform 
that allows us to do just that. 

## Fourier Transform

We can move from the time-domain into the *frequency-domain* through
a transformation of the signal known as the 
[*Fourier Transform*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), after
[Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier).
We're going to take a brief dive into the math behind it, but don't worry if 
it all doesn't click on your first read. Wrapping your head around what the 
Fourier Transform is doing can be difficult, but once you understand it, it 
can be used as very powerful tool. 

The Fourier Transform (FT) is a function that takes a time-domain 
signal as its input and produces a function of frequency as its output:
\begin{equation}
F(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-i2\pi xt}dt
\label{eq:fouriertransform}
\end{equation}
where $f(t)$ is our time-domain function, and $F(t)$ is our frequency-domain
function.

You might note those infinity signs above and below the integral symbol---
indeed, from the perspective of the FT, a *periodic* signal can only be 
considered periodic if it is periodic forever! Since we can't wait that long
to compute the FT, we can use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is
a computation-friendly version of the continuous FT (sometimes you'll 
hear people refer to the FFT which stands for the Fast Fourier Transform---
this is simply a particular *algorithm* for computing the DFT):

\begin{equation}
X(k)=\sum^{N-1}_{n=0}x(n)e^{-i2\pi\frac{kn}{N}}
\label{eq:dft}
\end{equation}

This may or may not look familiar, but just bear with me. $x(n)$ is our
digitally-sampled time-domain signal, and $X(k)$ is the resulting 
frequency-domain representation of it. $e^{-i2\pi\frac{kn}{N}}$ can
be rewritten using the (trigonometric) $sin$ and $cosine$ functions:
\begin{equation}
e^{-i2\pi\frac{kn}{N}} = \cos\left(2\pi \frac{kn}{N}\right) - i \sin\left(2\pi \frac{kn}{N}\right)
\label{eq:trig}
\end{equation}
So, when we rewrite the DFT in its less compact form:
\begin{equation}
X(k)=\sum^{N-1}_{n=0}x(n)\left[ \cos\left(2\pi \frac{kn}{N}\right) - i \sin\left(2\pi \frac{kn}{N}\right) \right]
\label{eq:dft-trig}
\end{equation}
we can see that what the DFT is actually doing is multiplying our original signal
by a bunch of sinusoids of different frequencies and summing the results, giving 
us a signal that tells us effectively "how much" of these frequencies the 
signal "contains".

How many frequencies and which ones depends on that value $N$, and is 
up to you to decide, however, there is a tradeoff: the larger $N$ is, the more
time it takes to collect those samples. While you get better frequency
resolution when $N$ is large, you get poorer time resolution, and vice
versa.

An important (and incredible) property of both the FT and the DFT is that they
are reversible without any loss of information or change to the signal: you 
can convert fromthe time-domain to the frequency-domain and back and recover
your original signal exactly. The inverse DFT (IDFT) 
looks remarkably similar to the DFT:
\begin{equation}
x(k)=\frac{1}{N}\sum^{N-1}_{n=0}X(n)e^{i2\pi\frac{kn}{N}}
\label{eq:idft}
\end{equation}
<!---The above equation had been in error and is altered to correct the domain inputs, and normalization--->
(Note that the X(n) and x(n) are swapped relative to the DFT, by convention there 
is a 1/N normalization, and, if you missed it, there is a little missing "-" sign 
in the exponent towards the   right-hand side).

It can be difficult to form an intuition for the FT and DFT based on the 
equations alone.  The following video provides a really nice visual demonstration
of how this all works:

<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spUNpyF58BY" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

While that is probably more math than you might normally come into contact with 
in a course on music psychology, the FT allows us to perform very clever types of 
analyses of sounds as we will see below. 



## Spectrum

Once a waveform has been converted from the time domain to the frequency domain 
using a Fourier transformation, the resulting representation is often referred to as its
*spectrum*. 
The spectrum is basically a snapshot of the component parts of whatever waveform 
that you fed into the Fourier transform.
You could do this with something as short as a recording of a pluck of a single note 
on a banjo or an entire symphony.

{% include begin-figure description="The spectrum of an audio signal." %}
{% include note author="jm" text="interactive spectrum example with 
the ability to blend components etc" %}
{% include end-figure %}

Looking at a sound's spectrum, we now have a more clear view of the frequency composition of a signal.
Although the DFT does actually produce the phase of each component, 
that information is often thrown away in the name of efficiency, which 
is also a tacit statement that it is a significantly less important feature
than the frequency information.

Another representation of the spectrum over time is called a *sonogram*:

</td></tr><tr><td>
{% include audio-connection outlet=playername inlet=metername %}
{% include audio-transport name=transportname %}
</td></tr></table>
{% include end-audio-example %}
{% include end-figure %}
Here, we can see a history of the spectrum over time, with the height
representing frequency, the brightness *magnitude* (related to amplitude),
and time along the x-axis.

The reason that we might want to make a sonogram is if we wanted to visually investigate 
the component parts of a sound.
For example, above we learned that a sound's timbre or tone color is partially determined by 
what combinations of wave forms make up the sound.
Looking at the images below, we are unable to see anything distinct in the timbres 
of a short clip of a clarinet versus an oboe in the time domain.

  </tr>
</table>
</body>

If we take both of these very short clips of audio and perform a Fourier transform
on these waveforms we can move them from the time domain to the frequency 
domain and suspend them in time.

    <td>{% include img-figure url="/MUTOR/assets/images/sonogram-oboe.png" description="Oboe C5 Frequency Domain" %}</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
</body>

Looking at these exact same clips of sound, but now in the frequency domain, we 
can see that the two sounds are very different.
Inspecting these audio clips in the frequency domain allows us to see an audio 
fingerprint of each of the instrument's timbres. 
Using spectrograms is only made possible with the Fourier transform and 
is the basis for investigating questions of musical timbre, automatic chord 
transcription, as well as many other tasks of musical analysis.
