<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">Webster's dictionary defines <i>harmony</i> as</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">2 <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>a : the combination of simultaneous musical notes in a chord<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>b : the structure of music with respect to the composition and progression of chords<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>c : the science of the structure, relation, and progression of chords</p>
<p class="p1">3 <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>a : pleasing or congruent arrangement of parts</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As we can see from the above definition, the word <i>harmony</i> often refers to either a chord, a progression of chords, or a consonant<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>(or generally speaking, pleasing) sonority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The task of defining harmony is a difficult one—is it a chord or a progression of chords?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>How are harmony and harmonic progression different from timbre and timbral evolution?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In this unit, we will discuss these questions and look at how composers in the 20th and 21st centuries view harmony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We will also look at the effects that tuning systems have on harmony.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Historical View of Harmony</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The term harmony comes from a Greek word that translates literally as "means of joining" and is related to the word for joint or shoulder [<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=harmony"><span class="s1">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=harmony</span></a>].<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In ancient Greek music, the term referred to the juxtaposition of different elements, but since the musical practice of the time did not include the simultaneous sounding of multiple notes, this concept was only used as a way of discussing the theoretical relationships between pitches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the Medieval period, composers began to write music in which two notes that formed a perfect consonance (fourths, fifths, or octaves) were sung simultaneously, and in the Renaissance Gioseffo Zarlino wrote of triadic harmony that included the imperfect consonances:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>thirds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>These descriptions pertain only to the structure of an isolated simultaneity, although it is clear that as far back as the 15th century, theorists understood the concept of harmony to encompass not only the relationships between simultaneously sounded pitches, but the relationships between chords.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, some theorists have considered harmony to be the progression through, and alternation of, consonant and dissonant sonorities. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The distinction between harmony and harmonic progression is an important one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Consider, for example, the C major chord in figure 1.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="index.cmaj.png" alt="cmaj.png"></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Figure 1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>C major triad.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the key of C major, this chord has a feeling of stability since it is the tonic of the key.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>However, in the key of F major, the same chord will sound unstable as if it should move to F.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>As we can see, the context in which a chord appears is important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Another example is the famous "Tristan chord"—the opening harmony of Richard Wagner's opera <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> (figure 2).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The nature of this sonority has been debated for decades, but the debate centers less around the chord itself, and more around the function and way in which it resolves.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="index.tristan.png" alt="tristan.png"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="wagner_tristan_opening.midi">Wagner_Tristan_opening.midi</a></span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The chord can easily be explained as a half-diminished seventh chord or as a French augmented 6th chord where the G# is an <i>appoggiatura</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>to the A, however, the way in which it resolves does not support either of these labels.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tuning and Temperament</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Since the time of J.S. Bach, equal-temperament has dominated western classical music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In this system, every semitone is of equal size in log-frequency (remember that our perception of pitch is logarithmic).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For a given number of semitones, <i>n</i>, we can calculate the frequency from a reference <i>f_r</i> using the formula</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="index.equal-temperament.png" alt="equal-temperament.png">.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Although a thorough discussion of tuning is beyond the scope of this unit (Wikipedia has numerous pages and links devoted to the topic), we can say a few things about equal temperament and the systems that it replaced.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Any tuning system must be measured against <i>just intonation</i> in which intervals are calculated by integer ratios, e.g. a just fifth is 3 / 2, a just fourth is 4 / 3, and a just major third is 5 / 4.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Although the just intervals are considered by many to be the most pleasing, they can lead to complex problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For example, a just major third above A1 (55 Hz) is 68.75 Hz, but if we use 55 Hz (A1) as our reference frequency and calculate a C#1 by going up in fifths, we arrive at 69.609375 (55 • 1.5 = 82.5 (E2) • 1.5 = 123.75 (B2) • 1.5 = 185.625 (F#3) • 1.5 = 278.4375 (C#4) / 4 = 69.609375).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>One solution to this problem is to tune certain keys as perfectly as possible and allow other more distant keys to be out of tune.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Equal temperament solves the problem by making every interval (with the exception of the octave) slightly out of tune.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For example, in the case of perfect fifths, in equal temperament,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="index.eq5.png" alt="eq5.png"></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">and in just intonation,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="index.j5.png" alt="j5.png">.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">An important technique that defines common practice music is the modulation to distant keys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>As the harmony moves away from the home key, tension increases, however, in a tuning system where the tonic key is tuned near just intonation and the degree to which a key is out of tune increases with the distance from the home key, modulation to distant keys results in a higher level of tension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the following listening example, you will hear the first minute of a <i>Capriccio</i> (FbWV 506) by Johann Jakob Froberger (1616-1667) played by Gustav Leonhardt on a harpsichord tuned to Baroque pitch and in a tuning other than equal temperament (most likely meantone temperament).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the second listening example, you will hear the same passage, but played on a piano in equal temperament.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Pay special attention to bars 7 and 8.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Tension and Release</b></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The progression of harmony from consonance through dissonance and back to consonance can be abstracted and seen as a buildup of tension and a release of that tension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The serialist composers of the post-war period (Boulez, Stockhausen, etc.) gave up the ability to create tension and release through harmonic progression as they abandoned the sonorities and harmonic syntax of the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The generation to follow (Grisey, Murail, Saariaho) sought new ways of creating tension and release without returning to the rules of the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In her article <i>Timbre and harmony: interpolations of timbral structures</i>, Kaija Saariao proposes a "sound / noise axis" that could replace the tonal system of consonance / dissonance as a way of creating tension and release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This is hear clearly in the opening seconds of her composition <i>Nymphea</i> for string quartet and electronics—here, the performers alternate between normal playing and noisy extended techniques such as playing on the bridge (listening example 3). <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In works such as Gérard Grisey's <i>Partiels</i> and Tristan Murail's <i>Gondwana</i>, the composers create a relationship between <i>harmonicity</i> and <i>inharmonicity.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the concept of harmonicity refers to similarity to the harmonic series.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In <i>Partiels</i>, the opening sonority—a harmonic series derived from the acoustical analysis of a bass trombone—is gradually transformed into an increasingly inharmonic sonority by gradually placing the highest pitches into lower octaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In figure xx, the top graph is a sonogram of the opening 2'30" of <i>Partiels</i> and the bottom is a plot of the roughness (see the unit on consonance and dissonance) of the sonority over time created using a modified version of Richard Parncutt's algorithm. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Although Grisey uses a very different system of harmony in <i>Partiels</i>, one can still see a constant transition between consonance and dissonance or tension and release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>About this issue, the composer writes in his own words:</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Two traits characterize the development of sounds:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>periodicity and the overtone spectrum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>These elements, which are very easy to identify, <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>give the piece continuity and a dynamic that corresponds rather closely to the cyclical form of human respiration:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>inhalation, exhalation and <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>rest or tension / collapse — relaxation — collection of energy.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Harmony, Timbre and Transformation</b></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The opening section of <i>Partiels</i> raises an interesting question:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>is there a difference between a chord and a timbre?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In this case, it would seem that Grisey constructed a chord out of the elements of a timbre.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>But, if a timbre is made up of a series of pitches, how is it different from a chord?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In most western classical music prior to the 20th century, harmony and timbre were considered two separate elements—the orchestration of a sonority could be done in many different ways and was often considered a subjective, surface-level detail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>However, in the 20th century, composers such as Olivier Messiaen began to think of timbre and harmony as inseparable, and it is likely that Grisey would refer to the opening sonority of <i>Partiels</i> as a timbre rather than a chord. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">A novel feature of <i>Partiels</i> is the idea of gradual timbral / harmonic evolution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the past, harmonic change and movement to new key areas was largely a discrete event, however, here, by only changing a few notes at a time by placing them in different octaves, Grisey creates a smooth transformation from one sonority to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Recently, <a href="addressbook://7D49BC15-8818-11D8-8262-000A9566D3CC:ABPerson"><span class="s1">David Wessel</span></a> has developed a Max/MSP (<a href="http://www.cycling74.com"><span class="s1">http://www.cycling74.com</span></a>) object that facilitates gradual timbral transformation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Here, a timbre is created using a large bank of sinusoidal oscillators and a gradual transformation to a new timbre is done by changing the frequency of one oscillator at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Download the following patch to experiment with different timbral transformations.</p>
