<div>Music is composed of sounds in the physical world. In this unit we will start with a physical description of sound, beginning by introductions to fundamental descriptors of sound waves (<a title="PhysicalDescriptionofSounds - PsycheLoui, Wed May 24 19:31:00 2006">PhysicalDescriptionofSounds</a>) such as frequency, amplitude, and phase (<a title="FrequencyAmplitudePhase - JohnMac, Wed May 24 21:27:00 2006">FrequencyAmplitudePhase</a>). This will be followed by a discussion of the visual representations of sound (<a title="DifferentVisualRepresentations - JohnMac, Thu May 25 20:09:00 2006">DifferentVisualRepresentations</a>). Two useful ways to represent sound are through the time and frequency domains. We will discuss the kinds of information that each of these representations affords, as well as the methods that enable switching between the different conceptualizations of time and frequency. In particular, we will focus on the frequency representation and highlight how the spectrogram, which is a visualization of the <a title="SpecTrum - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:23:00 2006">SpecTrum</a> of frequencies, allows us to visualize pitch, duration, timbre, and some aspects of harmony, which together encompass much of the basic materials of music.</div>

<div><strong>Physical Description of Sounds</strong><br/>
<br/>
Sound originates from the vibrations of particles through a medium. In our everyday world, sounds are most commonly transferred by vibrations of air molecules originating from a moving or vibrating source. These vibrations of air molecules cause small changes in air pressure, and our eardrum detects these minute modulations of air pressure and transmits it further along the auditory system, thus enabling the perception of sound.<br/>
<br/>
<a title="LongitudinalWaves - PsycheLoui, Wed May 24 19:57:00 2006">LongitudinalWaves</a> and Transverse waves together give a picture of what these variations in air pressure look like.<br/>
<br/>
A sine wave is given by the following general equation:<br/>
<blockquote><code>y=Asin(wt+b)</code><br/></blockquote>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/B3BF39D8-DCC1-4AA1-8B04-BD19AC274D61.gif" height="102" width="219"/> A tuning fork vibrates and thus emits waves of vibrations of air molecules around it, which propagate through the air<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/BE8BCC50-7982-42F3-8D85-E102FDFA45E1.gif" height="106" width="298"/> <em>Compression</em> and <em>rarefaction</em> of air molecules from a tuning fork, producing sound waves.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/9A2B5081-BB4B-42E8-BF8E-736A7E5F6C81.gif" height="207" width="310"/> The <em>compression</em> and <em>rarefaction</em> of air molecules form minute, but predictable, changes in the air pressure, which the ear drum then detects.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/4266FFFA-2F22-4DB9-9B92-4A801B29B110.gif" height="108" width="171"/> Changes in air pressure cause the ear drum to change its shape mechanically, thus transmitting the variations in air pressure to our auditory system.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, we see that <a title="AirPressureChanges - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:37:00 2006">AirPressureChanges</a> are necessary for the auditory system to perceive sound.<br/>

<div><b>PureTones</b></div>
<div><strong>What are “pure” tones?</strong><br/>
A <em>pure tone</em> is the sound produced by a single sine wave. It has only one frequency and is constant in amplitude. It is expressed by the formula:<br/>
<blockquote><code>y = Asin(wt+b)</code><br/></blockquote>
where A expresses amplitude, w expresses frequency, and b expresses phase shift (see <a title="FrequencyAmplitudePhase - JohnMac, Wed May 24 21:27:00 2006">FrequencyAmplitudePhase</a>). Thus, a pure tone may vary in several ways: amplitude, frequency, and phase. In general, the frequency of a sine wave gives rise to the percept of pitch, whereas the amplitude of the sine wave gives rise to loudness.<sup>1</sup><br/>
<br/>
When several sine waves of identical frequency are added together, the result is again a sine wave. For this relationship to hold, the frequency of the added sinusoids must be the same, but their phase angles and amplitudes may differ.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/A680BED3-7A7C-4E93-97D7-42D45BBC4C8C.gif" height="316" width="423"/><br/>
The addition of two sinusoids (<span style="color: red;">red</span>), resulting in a third sinusoid (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>). The addition of several sine waves (given the same frequency) produces another sine wave. This is a unique property of sinusoidal waveforms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<sup>1</sup> There are various ways in which this relationship may not hold; they will be discussed at a later unit.</div>

<div><b>FrequencyAmplitudePhase</b></div>
<div>A sinusoid can be described using three parameters: frequency, amplitude, and phase. Figure 1 shows the period and amplitude of a sinusoid. The period represents how long it takes for the waveform to repeat itself—in this example, it takes 1 unit of time. Often we will want to know how many periods there will be in one second which can be found by taking the inverse of the period—this is the frequency and has units of Hertz (Hz).<br/></div>
<div><br/>

Figure 1: A sinusoid showing the period and amplitude.<br/>
<br/>
Phase is a slightly more complex topic. In order to discuss phase, we need to introduce the concept of the unit circle (figure 2).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/5F46B59A-0985-4AE5-B23C-963D200A94E7.png" height="372" width="372"/><br/>
Figure 2: The unit circle.<br/>
<br/>
Recall from trigonometry that a sinusoid simply traces the distance along the <em>y</em>-axis as a point moves counter-clockwise along the unit circle starting at [1, 0](figure 3).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/13DF102E-3EC0-476E-B6AB-89AB594F4FF2.png" height="555" width="405"/><br/>
Figure 3: A sinusoid.<br/>
<br/>
If we follow the distance along the <em>x</em>-axis, the result is a cosine (figure 4).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="MPC%20Day%201%3A%201_23_14.html.resources/3C6F87AB-C186-4415-9C63-07BBD44558A4.png" height="500" width="500"/><br/>
Figure 4: A cosine.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between the sine and cosine is a <em>phase</em> shift of 90°. Why is that? A sine starts at 0 while a cosine starts at 1. In order for a sine to have a value of 1, the point must travel a quarter of the unit circle, or 90° (figures 5 &amp; 6).<br/>
<br/>

<div><b>DifferentVisualRepresentations</b></div>
<div>The waveforms that we have been looking at are representations of sound that exist in the time-domain. Recall that the <em>x</em>-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system is often called the domain and since our <em>x</em>-axis represents time, we say that we are looking at a <em>time-domain</em> representation of sound which gives us information about the temporal evolution of the sound. Another representation of sound that we will often encounter is the <em>frequency-domain</em> representation. In Figure 1, the top graph shows a typical time-domain representation of a sinusoid with a frequency of 440Hz (A4--the A above middle C). The bottom graph is a frequency-domain representation of the same sound. Notice that the maximum of the plot is approximately 440Hz.<br/></div>
<div><br/>

Figure 1: Time-domain (top) vs. frequency-domain (bottom).<br/>
<br/>
Notice also that time is not represented in any way in the frequency domain. As we will discuss below, the Fourier transform is a sort of averaging operation. Although this can be problematic, there are ways of re-introducing time into frequency-domain representations of a sound.</div>

We can convert a time-domain representation of a sound into a frequency-domain representation using the <em>Fourier transform</em>. The Fourier transform decomposes a complex signal into it's sinusoidal componants often referred to as <em>partials</em>. If the partials are integer multiples of some fundamental frequency that is within the <a title="ExistenceRegion - PsycheLoui, Wed May 24 19:57:00 2006">ExistenceRegion</a> of pitch, they are called <em>harmonics</em>.<br/>

<br/>
Because the Fourier transform is a continuous function, it's discrete counterpart, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is often used in practical applications, especially digital audio. In signal processing literature, the DFT is often referred to as the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform—a class of implementation techniques optimized for speed) or the STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform—see below).<br/>
<br/>
The DFT operates on a short section of a sampled signal often called a window. The discontinuities at the beginning and end of the section of a signal to be analyzed can produce non-linearities in the spectrum. To minimize this, the section of a signal is usually smoothed with a window function (figure 1).<br/>
<br/>
The Fourier transform has the important property that the original signal can be recovered by performing an <em>inverse</em> Fourier transform.<br/>
<br/>
Here's where the stuff on the uncertainty in spectral measurements will be.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Spectrogram</strong><br/>
<a title="DifferentVisualRepresentations - JohnMac, Thu May 25 20:09:00 2006">DifferentVisualRepresentations</a> of sounds can help obtain a scientific understanding of the components of sounds. One way to visualize musical sounds is using a <em>spectrogram</em>. The spectrogram (also known as a sonogram) is a graph that represents waveforms of different frequencies and amplitudes over time. This is especially useful for visualizing musical sounds. In a spectrogram, typically the y axis represents frequency, the x axis represents time, and the color (or z axis) represents amplitude.<br/>
The spectrogram is a result of the Fourier transform/FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)/STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform), which enable the conversion of sounds from the waveform domain to the frequency (or spectral) domain. Although computationally intensive by hand, algorithms to accomplish different varieties of Fourier transforms are available via <code>Matlab</code>, <code>R</code>, and other programming languages.<br/>

<br/>
A number of readily-available programs allow one to draw a spectrogram as a picture, and then play it as a sound. <a target="_blank" title="External link to http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Coagula.htm" href="http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Coagula.htm">Coagula</a> is a software enabling the synthesis of sounds from images.

<div><br/></div>
<div>In this unit we began by describing <a title="PhysicalDescriptionofSounds - PsycheLoui, Wed May 24 19:31:00 2006">sound</a> as vibrations causing changes in <a title="AirPressureChanges - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:37:00 2006">air pressure</a>. We saw that a <a title="PureTones - PsycheLoui, Thu May 25 21:44:00 2006">pure tone</a> is the simplest sound, and can be described by the <a title="FrequencyAmplitudePhase - JohnMac, Wed May 24 21:27:00 2006">frequency, amplitude, and phase</a> of a sinusoid.</div>
<div><br/>
The reader should emerge with some understanding of how to estimate these three parameters from a sine wave, and how combinations of sound waves form the percept of complex sounds, which can be described by the time-domain waveform. The range of audible frequencies for humans is 20-20,000Hz, and the <a title="ExistenceRegion - PsycheLoui, Wed May 24 19:57:00 2006">existence region</a> of pitch falls within this range. By virtue of the Fourier transform, sounds in the time domain can be converted into the frequency (or <a title="SpecTrum - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:23:00 2006">spectral</a>) domain; thus, the Fourier transform and its varieties (FFT, STFT, DFT) enable transformations between <a title="DifferentVisualRepresentations - JohnMac, Thu May 25 20:09:00 2006">different visual representations</a> of sounds. The temporal and <a title="SpectralEnvelope - PsycheLoui, Thu May 25 21:46:00 2006">spectral envelopes</a>, which can be estimated from the time-domain and spectral-domain representations respectively, account for much of what we perceive as timbre, or sound quality. The <a title="SpecTrum - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:23:00 2006">spectrogram</a> is a useful way to visualize musical sounds, as it shows the <a title="SpecTrum - PsycheLoui, Fri May 26 17:23:00 2006">harmonic partials</a> and amplitude as a function of time. The loss of <a title="FrequencyAmplitudePhase - JohnMac, Wed May 24 21:27:00 2006">phase information</a> in the spectrogram is of relatively little perceptual importance in simple sounds.<br/>
<br/>
How do these physical attributes of sound become interpreted by the human mind to form music? To what extent do phase and amplitude matter in sound perception? In the next unit we will further explore the roles of the auditory system and the human mind in perceiving music.<br/></div>
