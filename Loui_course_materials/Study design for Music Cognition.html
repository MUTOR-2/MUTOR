This will become the basis of the Methods and Materials section of your final paper. Your experiment design should include at least three sections: Subjects, Stimuli, Procedures, and Data Analysis. Each section can further have subsections. If you are using a pre-existing survey or experiment design (which is highly recommended), please cite the sources of your materials and include a References section.</div><div>Subjects section should include an estimate of the number of subjects, and how you plan to recruit them. Stimuli section should include descriptions of all materials that will be presented to the subject, in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce them. Procedures should include descriptions of all the actions you take to arrive at your results, including instructions to human subjects. Data analysis section should include your plans for visualizing and comparing your results, including your dependent and independent variables, whether you are using a between-subjects or within-subjects design, and some information about the format in which you plan to collect the data (e.g. Excel, Google forms, Google spreadsheets, scoring by hand, etc.)</div><div>*You are encouraged to use labeled diagrams and/or figures to illustrate your experiment design. The page count does not include any diagrams or figures. The page count also does not include all your stimulus materials, which should be submitted as an appendix.<br/></div><div>Two examples of Methods sections are now posted on Blackboard. </div><div style="letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: bold;">DUE Tuesday, 11/13 at 11:59pm</span></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
