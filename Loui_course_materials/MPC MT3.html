<li>What is the evidence for the shared syntactic integration of resources hypothesis (SSIRH) between music and language? (3 points)<br/></li>
<li>What are the components of sounds that differ among the world’s languages, and how do we quantify these differences? (4 points)</li>
<li>Give an example of an expectation violation a) in music, and b) in language. What are the components of event-related potentials that index these violations of expectations? (5 points)</li>
<li>What are the three types of expectations that, when violated slightly, are hypothesized to give rise to emotional arousal in music? (3 points) What is the evidence that these three types of expectations are related (i.e. one type of expectation can become another)? (2 points) </li>
<li>What is the Vocal Generosity Effect and how was it discovered? Provide your preferred explanation for why the Vocal Generosity Effect might exist, and justify your reasoning. (5 points)</li>
<li>How do we control our own actions to maximize accuracy in the production of musical sounds? What does tone-deafness tell us about the neural pathways involved in maximizing accuracy? (6 points)</li>
<li>How do we measure expectations a) with adult human behavioral paradigms, b) using electroencephalography (EEG), and c) in infants? (6 points) </li>
<li>What are the perceptual bases of different patterns in voice leading, and what are the physical principles that give rise to these voice leading patterns? In your answer compare and contrast a canon (e.g. Pachelbel’s Canon) and a chorale (e.g. Bach’s four-part chorales). (6 points)</li>
<li>BONUS Question: Write a garden path sentence with the words “garden path” in it. (1 point)</li>
